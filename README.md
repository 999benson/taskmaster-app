# TaskMaster App

TaskMaster is essentially a digital to-do list for people who wish to stay on top of their tasks and keep track of their progress. The main functionality and purpose is a list so there should not be too many functionalities for users to get distracted with. Interface will be clean and straightforward to use. Users may track their progress as they use the app. The tracker will reflect userâ€™s history of completion rate, so they know which period they have been slacking off and which periods they are staying on top of things. Users may add new lists of their tasks for the day and cross it off when it is done. The crossed-off task will be pushed to a "Done" list and the progress tracker will update the task completion progress of the day.
Users may also track their history of tasks by querying by date or keyword.
